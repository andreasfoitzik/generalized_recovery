Generalized Recovery characterizes a method to recover physical probabilities, marginal utilities and the discount rate from risk-neutral probabilities. We focus on large-state-space scenarios, with more states than time periods. So far, recovery is not possible without further assumptions. To provide a solution, we introduce an assumption to reduce the number of unknown parameters for the pricing kernel. Based on dimensionality reduction, recovery is possible in real-world large-state-space scenarios.
